Binary Search Algorithm
Algorithm:

Start with a sorted array and define two pointers: low (beginning of the array) and high (end of the array).
Calculate the middle index: mid = (low + high) / 2.
Compare the middle element with the target value:
If the middle element matches the target, return the index.
If the target is smaller than the middle element, search in the left half (high = mid - 1).
If the target is larger, search in the right half (low = mid + 1).
Repeat steps 2-3 until the element is found or low > high.
If not found, return -1 (indicating the element is not present).
