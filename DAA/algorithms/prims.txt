1. Primâ€™s Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)
Algorithm:

Initialize an empty Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).
Select any arbitrary node as the starting node and mark it as part of the MST.
Repeat the following until all vertices are included in the MST:
Select the minimum-weight edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.
Add this edge to the MST.
Mark the newly included vertex as part of the MST.
Continue until all vertices are included in the MST.
