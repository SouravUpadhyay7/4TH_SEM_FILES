2. Quick Sort Algorithm
Algorithm:

Choose a pivot element from the array (usually the last element).
Partition the array such that all elements smaller than the pivot are on the left and all larger elements are on the right.
Recursively apply Quick Sort to the left and right subarrays.
Combine the sorted subarrays to get the final sorted array.
