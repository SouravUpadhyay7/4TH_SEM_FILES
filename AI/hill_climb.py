# Algorithm: Hill Climbing for Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

# Step 1: Start

# Step 2: Represent the cities using a distance matrix or coordinate points

# Step 3: Generate an initial solution (random order of cities)

# Step 4: Calculate the path length (total distance) of the current solution

# Step 5: Generate all neighboring solutions by swapping pairs of cities in the current solution

# Step 6: For each neighbor:
#         - Calculate its path length
#         - Keep track of the neighbor with the shortest path

# Step 7: If the best neighbor has a shorter path than the current solution:
#         - Update the current solution to the best neighbor
#         - Repeat Steps 5â€“7

# Step 8: If no better neighbor exists, stop the algorithm (local optimum reached)

# Step 9: Output the best path and its length

# Step 10: End
