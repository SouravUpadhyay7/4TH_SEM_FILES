# write a program to check vowels or not


n = input("Enter the alphabet to be tested: ")

if n in ('a','e','i','o','u','A','E','I','O','U'):
  print(n,"is a vowel.")
else:
  print(n,"is a consonant.")



  # Algorithm to check if a character is a vowel

# Step 1: Start

# Step 2: Take input from the user (a single alphabet)

# Step 3: Check if the input character is one of the following:
#         'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'

# Step 4: If the character is in the above list:
#         - Print that the character is a vowel

# Step 5: Else:
#         - Print that the character is a consonant

# Step 6: End
